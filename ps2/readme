4.Write a program to find the sum of perimeters of n different kalakand
Formula: weight of dry fruits > 5:
perimeter = quantity_of_milk^quantity_of_sugar
    weight of dry fruits <= 5:
	perimeter = quantity_of_milk+quantity_of_sugar
Input
Enter the number of kalakands:
2
Enter the quantity_of_milk, quantity_of_sugar, weight_of_dry_fruits for kalakand 1:
1 1 6
Enter the quantity_of_milk, quantity_of_sugar, weight_of_dry_fruits for kalakand 2:
1 1 4
Output
The sum of perimeters is 3.00
