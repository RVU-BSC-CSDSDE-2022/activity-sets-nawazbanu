	volume = amount_of_sugar+amount_of_color+amount_of_flour
Enter 0 for paneer as input
Enter 1 for besan as input
Input
Enter the number of jalebis:
2
Enter the amount_of_sugar, amount_of_color, amount_of_flour, type for jalebi 1:
1 1 6 0
Enter the amount_of_sugar, amount_of_color, amount_of_flour, type for kalakand 2:
1 1 4 1
Output
The sum of volume is  12.0
